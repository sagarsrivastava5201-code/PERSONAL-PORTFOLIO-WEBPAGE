Hi! I’m Sagar Srivastava, a passionate and detail-oriented Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a growing interest in modern tools like React.js. This portfolio represents my personal journey in web development — from learning the basics to building complete, interactive web pages.

My goal is to create clean, responsive, and user-focused web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into real products through structured code and engaging design. This portfolio website highlights not just my technical skills but also my mindset — always learning, always building.

In the Projects section, you’ll find three projects I’ve worked on:

Project 1: Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Tribute Page
This was one of my first projects using pure HTML and CSS. It’s a simple, clean layout honoring the legacy of Dr. Kalam. You can click on the “View Project” button to open and explore this project directly from the portfolio.

Project 2: Calculator using JavaScript
This is a fully functional calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helped me understand user interaction, logic implementation, and real-time DOM updates. Currently, the project is not linked, so clicking the “View Project” will not open a page — I plan to link it in future updates.

Project 3: Amazon Clone (UI Only)
This is a simple clone of the Amazon homepage interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a great learning experience for layout structuring and responsive design. This project is also not yet linked in the portfolio, but I’ll be updating it soon as I refine the code.

The About Me section includes more about my approach and what drives me as a developer. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code, and I’m always exploring better design and development practices. Currently, I’m focused on learning React.js, improving my UI/UX design understanding, and collaborating on impactful web projects.

This portfolio is designed to be responsive, so it works well across mobile and desktop devices. I’ve also used some basic interactivity with JavaScript — for example, the first project opens dynamically on button click using a script.

I built this portfolio to reflect not only the skills I have now but also my readiness to learn and grow. I’m confident that with the right mentorship and exposure through an internship, I can contribute to real-world projects and strengthen my development abilities further.

Please feel free to reach out via the Contact Me section — you’ll find my email, phone number, and LinkedIn profile there. I’d be excited to work in a team environment where I can grow, collaborate, and build meaningful digital experiences.

Thank you for viewing my portfolio!
